# Apollo Lunar Module Luminary Program P-12 Ascent Guidance #
Hello! I assume if you're looking at this page, you're either lurking through my projects (I'm flattered) or you're here to grade my AA528 Final Project entitled: Analysis of Apollo Lunar Ascent Guidance.
If you would like to run this simulation, you will need to download numpy, numpy-quaternion, plotly, scipy and tqdm to run this code.
The simulation is in "ascent.ipynb", simply hit run all cells. The simulation data will be output to a file called "sim_att.npy" in your current working directory.
You can then run "plot.ipynb" to generated plots and animations of the trajectory to visualize how the Lunar Module would conduct the powered ascent.
